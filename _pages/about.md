Hi! I'm a PhD student at [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/) and Université de Montréal supervised by [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.quebec/en/person/bengio-yoshua/). Currently, I am doing a Research Internship at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/). My current research interests include Meta-Learning and the design of efficient models. 

Previously, I did my Bachelors in Computer Science at University of Oxford ([WhiRL](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/)), working with [Prof. Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/) and [Dr. Luisa Zintgraf](https://luisazintgraf.com/) on Meta-Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 
<!-- During this time, I did research internships at University of Kyoto working with [Prof. Atsuko Sehara-Fujisawa](https://zfin.org/ZDB-LAB-160803-1) and at [Brave Software](https://brave.com/).  -->
